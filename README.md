# Phase 1: Ask
Business Task: Cyclistics wants casual riders to purchase the annual membership to increase their revenue. The company will do that by analyzing how both casual riders and annual members on how they differ.

Stakeholders: Lily Moreno, director of marketing and Cyclistics executive team and Cyclistics analytics team

# Phase 2: Prepare
Source: April 2023 - March 2024 Cyclistic trip data.


# Phase 5: Share
Casual riders mostly ride on the weekends and uses them as leisure while annual members tend to ride all week and rides the bikes for commute. I would suggest that to make casual riders become annual members, focus on the leisure details and make a discount on the weekends.
